# Genome_to_Protein
Pyhton pipleine that takes a genome sequence and returns a protein sequence.

The first step in this program pipeline involves generating protein sequences from a genome sequence. 
The entered sequence is taken by the program and read through line by line, the full sequence of nucleotides is added to a string which is then used to create the protein sequences. The program then reads through the sequence codon by codon until it finds a start codon ‘ATG’;  when one is found the program starts recording the sequence adding the next codon along until it reaches a stop codon, either TGA, TAA, or TAG. Upon reaching a stop codon the program stops recording the sequence and searches for the next start codon and repeats the process;  simultaneously the program converts the codons, for each protein sequence generated, into their respective amino-acid codes. The program then iterates through this process again for each reading frame of the genome sequence; first the forward 3 frames are read and converted, and then the reverse compliment sequence created and read through for the reverse 3 frames. After this the program compiles these sequences into a new FastA file.
